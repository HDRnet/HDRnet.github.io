## What is the Health Data Research Network?

The Health Data Research Network (HDRN) is a community of practice that aims to establish a collaborative network that unites universities, local governmental bodies, national research initiatives, technological industry leaders and pharmaceutical companies to advance and promote standardized practices in data handling, security, and analysis. 

HDRN is funded by University of Bristol Division of Research, Enterprise and Innovation.

## What are we doing?

We are organizing monthly workshops that discuss about specific topics on health data science, from data access to patient and public involvement.
Check the upcoming events.

The events will be an opportunity to share knowledge, discuss and agree best practices, and networking.
Taking inspiration from [The Turing Way](https://book.the-turing-way.org/index.html) and [Data Hazards](https://datahazards.com/), each workshop will be reflected in a chapter of a live, collaborative book on standard practices for health data science.

HDRN is proud of fostering an inclusive community and wants to make sure our events are accessible to people with a range of different circumstances and needs. If you are a parent or carer affiliated to the University of Bristol, and would like to attend one of our workshops out of your normal working hours, we would be happy to support you.
