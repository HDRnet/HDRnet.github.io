    "text": "What is the Health Data Research Network?\nThe Health Data Research Network (HDRN) is a community of practice that aims to establish a collaborative network that unites universities, local governmental bodies, national research initiatives, technological industry leaders and pharmaceutical companies to advance and promote standardized practices in data handling, security, and analysis.\nHDRN is funded by University of Bristol Division of Research, Enterprise and Innovation.\n\n\nWhat are we doing?\nWe are organizing monthly workshops that discuss about specific topics on health data science, from data access to patient and public involvement. Check the upcoming events.\nThe events will be an opportunity to share knowledge, discuss and agree best practices, and networking. Taking inspiration from The Turing Way and Data Hazards, each workshop will be reflected in a chapter of a live, collaborative book on standard practices for health data science.\n\n\nWhat should I do next?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoin our mailing list\n\n\nSign up to our alerts mailing list to keep informed of new events.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegister to our events\n\n\nBook onto workshops via our online booking forms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck the best practices book\n\n\nComing soon.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items",
