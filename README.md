## Making changes to the website

We are happy to receive issues or pull requests for this website. Members of the team can also get push access from an admin.

We use [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) to build the website, and this happens automatically when you push your changes back up to GitHub, via a [GitHub Action](https://github.com/Bristol-Training/bristol-training.github.io/blob/main/.github/workflows/publish-page.yaml).

To add courses, please edit the `.yml` files in the [`courses` directory](https://github.com/Bristol-Training/bristol-training.github.io/tree/main/courses). We use [Quarto listings](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-listings.html#yaml-listing-content) to compile these onto the landing page.

To preview your changes locally before committing/pushing, install Quarto and then run:

```bash
