## Making changes to the website

We are happy to receive issues or pull requests for this website.
Members of the team can also get push access from an admin.

We use [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) to build the website, and this happens automatically when you merge changes to the `main` branch on GitHub, via a [GitHub Action](https://github.com/Bristol-Training/bristol-training.github.io/blob/main/.github/workflows/publish-page.yaml).

To preview your changes locally before committing/pushing, install Quarto and then run:

```bash
